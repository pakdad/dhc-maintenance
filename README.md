# Predictive Maintenance of Pre-Insulated Bounded Pipes in District Heating

This project aims to provide a predictive maintenance solution for the pre-insulated bounded pipes used in district heating systems. The solution is implemented using a Python model.

## Overview
Pre-insulated bounded pipes are an important component of district heating systems, as they are used to transport hot water from the central heating plant to individual buildings. Regular maintenance is necessary to ensure the optimal performance and longevity of these pipes. However, traditional maintenance methods are reactive and can result in unexpected downtime and repair costs.

To address this issue, this project provides a predictive maintenance solution based on machine learning algorithms. The model analyzes various parameters such as temperature, size, and length, to predict the condition of the pipes and proactively schedule maintenance when necessary.

## Requirements
The following libraries and packages are required to run the model:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Rainflow
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Request
- Seaborn
- Imblearn
- Xgboost

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```css
git clone https://github.com/pakdad/dhc-maintenance.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```css
cd dhc-maintenance
```
3. Run the `PdM_Walkthrough.ipynb` file:
```css
jupyter notebook
```
## Funding
